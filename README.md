# Memory Fragmentation Simulation

A simple Java console program that simulates memory allocation using fixed-size memory blocks.  
It supports classic allocation strategies and shows internal fragmentation for each block.

## Features

- Allocate memory using:
  - First-Fit
  - Best-Fit
  - Worst-Fit
- Deallocate memory using a process ID.
- View memory status:
  - Block number
  - Size
  - Start–end addresses
  - Allocation status
  - Process ID
  - Internal fragmentation
